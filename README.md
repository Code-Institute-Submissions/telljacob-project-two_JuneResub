## Features

### Navigation

This is a one page site with as little to clutter the page I could.

### Media Links
The pages purpose was to be an actual tool a user like myself can use while studying. Putting in links to motivational videos and music I listen to saves time and using this page I can pace my studying and keep to my brakes.


## Validator Testing

I have tried the website on Chrome, Firefox and all possible screen sizes using Devtools.

HTML - W3C Validator: No errors

CSS - Jigsaw Validator: No errors

## Challanges

### 

## Technical difficulties in development
- Problems getting reset button to work. 

## Deployment
The site was deployed from Github pages:
- You get to Github pages by going to settings in the repository.
- From there you scroll down until you see "Github Pages" and press the hyperlink saying "Check it out here!"
- In the dropdown menu for "Branch:" choose main, in the next box choose "main" and save.

The live site can be found [here](https://telljacob.github.io/project-one/index.html).
